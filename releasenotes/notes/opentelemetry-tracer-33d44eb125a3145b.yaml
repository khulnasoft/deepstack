    Added out-of-the-box support for the OpenTelemetry Tracer. This allows you to instrument pipeline and component
    runs using OpenTelemetry and send traces to your preferred backend.

    To use the OpenTelemetry Tracer you need to have the `opentelemetry-sdk` package installed in your environment.
    To instruct Deepstack to use the OpenTelemetry Tracer, you have multiple options:

    * Run your Deepstack application using the `opentelemetry-instrument` command line tool as described in the
     [OpenTelemetry documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/python/automatic/#configuring-the-agent).
      This behavior can be disabled by setting the `DEEPSTACK_AUTO_TRACE_ENABLED_ENV_VAR` environment variable to `false`.
    * Configure the tracer manually in your code using the `opentelemetry` package:
      ```python
      from opentelemetry import trace
      from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.http.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter
      from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
      from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor

      # Service name is required for most backends
      resource = Resource(attributes={
          SERVICE_NAME: "deepstack"
      })

      traceProvider = TracerProvider(resource=resource)
      processor = BatchSpanProcessor(OTLPSpanExporter(endpoint="http://localhost:4318/v1/traces"))
      traceProvider.add_span_processor(processor)
      trace.set_tracer_provider(traceProvider)

      # Auto-configuration
      import deepstack.tracing
      deepstack.tracing.auto_enable_tracing()

      # Or explicitly
      from deepstack.tracing import OpenTelemetryTracer

      tracer = traceProvider.get_tracer("my_application")
      tracing.enable_tracing(OpenTelemetryTracer(tracer))
      ```
