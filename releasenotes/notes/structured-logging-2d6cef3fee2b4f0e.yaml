    Deepstack now supports structured logging out-of-the box.
    Logging can be separated into 3 categories:
    - If [`structlog`](https://www.structlog.org/en/stable/) is not installed, Deepstack will
      use the standard Python logging library with whatever configuration is present.
    - If `structlog` is installed, Deepstack will log through [`structlog`](https://www.structlog.org/en/stable/) using
      structlog's console renderer.
      To disable structlog, set the environment variable `DEEPSTACK_LOGGING_IGNORE_STRUCTLOG_ENV_VAR` to `true`.
    - To log in JSON, install [`structlog`](https://www.structlog.org/en/stable/) and
      - set the environment variable `DEEPSTACK_LOGGING_JSON` to `true` or
      - enable JSON logging from Python
        ```python
        import deepstack.logging

        deepstack.logging.configure_logging(use_json=True)
        ```
