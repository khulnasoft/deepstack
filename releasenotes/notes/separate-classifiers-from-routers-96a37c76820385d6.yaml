    Remove routing functionality from DocumentLanguageClassifier and rename TextLanguageClassifer to TextLanguageRouter.
    Classifiers in Deepstack 2.x change metadata values but do not route inputs to multiple outputs. The latter is reserved for routers.
    Use DocumentLanguageClassifier in combination with MetaDataRouter to classify and route documents in indexing pipelines.
